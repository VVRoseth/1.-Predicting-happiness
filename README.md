# Predicting Happiness

This project seeks to predict individual happiness using features classified under seven categories: 

1. Health 
2. Wealth
3. Personality traits
4. Educational attainment 
5. Labor market status
6. Personal characteristics
7. Family 

The data was produced by the World Bank group under the STEP Skills Measurement Program. This program has been implemented in 15 countries and part of it focuses on gathering data from individuals through household surveys. The dataset has 1,162 features that cover a wide range of aspects of respondents' lives (from assets to reading and writting comprehension, from job stability to socio-economic status during formative years). 

This repository contains the following files: 

- Notebook 0 - Technical Report: Overall description of project goal, methodology and findings 
- Notebook 1 - First wave clean: First exploration of available datasets 
- Notebook 2 - Feature selection and EDA: Walk through all variables, identification of connections between variables and selection of 90 variables. 
- Notebook 3 - Exploratory Analysis: Includes correlation heatmaps for each category to identify possible colinearity, and correlation heatmaps between variables and the dependent variable 
- Notebook 4 - Models: Contains ten models, five for multiclass classification and five for binary classifications
- Data Dictionary: Notebook with all features and their original units 
- Presentation of preliminary results
